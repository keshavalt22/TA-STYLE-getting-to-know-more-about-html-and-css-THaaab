            <b>Laka Glacier</b> Trek is about 8 km from <b>Bhagsu Nath</b> and in all 13 km from <b>Mcleodganj</b>. 
            Right from winters to June, there is snow and ice at the glacier. March to June is the best time for this trek. 
            Post-June, glacier begins to decrease and by July/August, not much snow will be left.
        </p>
        <p>
            This offbeat trek to the <b>Laka Glacier</b> offers some of the most amazing views of <i>Dhauladhar mountain</i> range and Kangra valley. 
        </p>
        <p>
            An interesting aspect of this trek is that it lies near the snowline, a mere trek of 13 km will take you to <b>Laka Glacier</b>. If you are looking for long-weekend trek,
            this is one of the most popular and beautiful trek that you can do in short duration.
            From July onwards the glacier starts to melt and during post monsoon period there is no snow at the glacier and you only see the moraines,
            whereas during pre-monsoon period (March to June) the glacier is full of snow and it is the best time to trek to <b>Laka Glacier</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your trek will commence at <b>Bhagsu Nag</b>, and from where the steep ascent towards Triund will begin. You will pass through <i>Oak, Rhododendrons and deodar trees</i>,
            till you reach a vast alpine meadow called Triund Top, from where you can spectacle the grandeur view of the Kangra Valley and <b>Dhauladhar ranges</b>.
