        <p>2018 we celebrated our tenth anniversary. 
            In just ten short years we have worked with partners in more than 50 countries worldwide and helped establish more than 30 new protected areas home to more than 150 endangered species and a staggering 20,000 species overall. 
            Through strategic partnerships we continue to push the boundaries of cutting-edge science and technologies for conservation, 
            and achieve unprecedented economies of scale for maximum impact.

        The Nature Conservancy
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Nature Conservancy works with local communities, businesses, and individuals to protect over 100 million acres of land around the globe. 
        The goal of this organization is to preserve entire wildlife communities along with their rich species diversity, a holistic approach that's vital to the health of our planet. 
        One of the Nature Conservancy's more innovative conservation approaches is debt-for-nature swaps, which maintain the biodiversity of developing countries in exchange for forgiveness of their debts. 
        These debt-for-nature initiatives have been successful in such wildlife-rich countries as Panama, Peru, and Guatemala.

        The World Wildlife Fund
    </h2>
    <p>
        The World Wildlife Fund works with multilateral and bilateral agencies to promote sustainable development in the world's poorest countries. 
        Its aims are threefold â€” to protect natural ecosystems and wild populations, to minimize pollution, and to promote efficient, sustainable use of natural resources. 
        The WWF focuses its efforts on multiple levels, starting with specific wildlife habitats and local communities and expanding upward to governments and global networks of non-government organizations. 
        This organization's official mascot is the Giant Panda, probably the world's most famous near-extinct mammal.
