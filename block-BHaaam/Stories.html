            The news about endangered species tends to be pretty bleak. That definitely proved true in 2016, but the past year also saw quite a few successes. 
            Here are some of the best news stories from 2016, as chosen from the “Extinction Countdown” archives and by experts and conservation groups around the globe.

    <h2>
        Trafficking and Trade
    </h2>
    <p>
        The illegal wildlife trade affects hundreds of species around the world and has put quite a few on the fast track toward extinction. Luckily, several of them received important support at this fall’s meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, 
        which banned or limited international trade for several imperiled species, including pangolins, the African grey parrot, and several kinds of sharks. “Almost all of the decisions were really based on science,” says Susan Lieberman, 
        vice president for international policy for the Wildlife Conservation Society. “You have to celebrate when that happens.”

        Of course, what makes the CITES action good news is that we’re stepping up to help species that have become critically imperiled. 
        “It’s good news that governments are recognizing the risks these species are in,” Lieberman says. 
        “It’s bad news because the situation for these species is really horrible.”

    <p>
        Outside of CITES, elephants also got a boost when the U.S. adopted tighter regulations in the trade of ivory. 
        “The new regulations will make it much harder for criminals to use the United States as a staging ground for illegal ivory trade,” Ginette Hemley, senior vice president of wildlife conservation at WWF, said this past June. 
        “They also send a strong signal to the international community that the U.S. is committed to doing its part to save elephants in the wild.”

    <h2>
        A Foxy Recovery
    </h2>
    <p>
        The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had a number of Endangered Species Act success stories this year, 
        but the best was probably April's announcement that three subspecies of island fox native to California's Channel Islands had recovered and are now no longer considered to be at risk. 
        This marked the fasted recovery under the ESA to date and reflects 12 years of intense conservation efforts by several dedicated partners on the federal, state and local level.

    <h2>
        The Little Guys
    </h2>
    <p>
        A few smaller creatures belong on our list, as well. “This year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finally took bees seriously,” says Scott Hoffman Black, 
        executive director of the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. 
        Seven species of Hawaiian yellow-faced bees received endangered species status, and similar protection has been proposed for the rusty-patched bumblebee. 
        “That’s pretty big,” Black says. “We’ve never had a bee listed before.”
