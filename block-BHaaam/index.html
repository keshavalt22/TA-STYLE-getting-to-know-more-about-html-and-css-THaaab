            Forest fires often reach or exceed temperatures of 2,000° Fahrenheit—that’s equivalent to one-fifth the temperature of the surface of the sun. 
            What is the impact of such high temperatures on the soil and plants of our forests? 
            And how do the intensity and heat of a wildfire impact its behavior, smoke and the surrounding weather?
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent decades the number, severity and overall size of wildfires has increased across the world. In fact, 
            in recent years wildfire season in all over the world was recorded the largest fire in acres burned, most destructive fire in property loss and deadliest fires in the state’s history.
        </p>
        <p>
            For years, catastrophic wildfires have threatened forests throughout the world. 
            Wildfires have increased in both size and severity, and with them the risks to communities, natural resources, and firefighter safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fire season now spans the entire year. Before summer even begins, forests are primed in large parts of the country for large fires that spread rapidly in trees that are dehydrated from drought, 
            compromised from fighting off bugs, and often competing for space in overly dense forests.
        </p>
        <p>
            A “wildfire” can be defined as any type of uncontrolled fire that is spreading across wildland, including pastureland, forests, grasslands and peatlands. (Sometimes, 
            fires are started intentionally and in a controlled manner, including during “prescribed burning”.)

        Amazon wildfire
    </h2>

        The majority of fires in the Amazon are not actually burning in standing rainforests, but on lands that were altered for agro-pastoral use, timber extraction, 
        infrastructure development, or that are in different stages of forest regrowth. 
        The Amazon is home to about 30 million people, and fires are an inexpensive method for clearing the land for planting
    </p>
    <p>
        In years of drought, such as 2005, 2010 and 2016, fire activity increased, due in part to the use of fires in agriculture that spread to areas not intended for burning, including the forest edges. 
        However, one peculiarity about this year’s active fire season is the absence of drought. 
        Precipitation during the May-July trimester was near normal or above normal in the western Amazon, although July 2019 was one of second warmest since 2000. 
        This is relevant to fires because a warmer environment leads to faster evapotranspiration rates, which in turn leads to faster vegetation water stress and greater susceptibility to fires.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s too early to say precisely how much of the current increase in fire activity is due to which driver, 
        but this year’s climate anomalies alone are unlikely to explain it all without factoring in changes in human activities such as deforestation.

        Australia Bushfire
    </h2>

        With evidence that climate change is causing Earth's temperatures to rise, we are seeing fires around the world increase and occur in areas that have not historically experienced them. 
        Some have said that the bushfires in New South Wales and Queensland Australia are a regular natural occurrence. However, scientists and experts alike (even firefighters agree) 
        that the fires here have been increasing in size, duration, and intensity and causing unprecedented damage to the environment and local wildlife. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While it is not within our scope as a reforestation organization to halt forest fires, we always look to the future in these situations, to be prepared for restoration as soon as possible. 
        And with dedicated business supporters like Trafalgar who are committed to reforestation in Australia, along with knowledgeable local partners on the ground, we hope to make a positive impact for nature and biodiversity. 
    </p>

        According to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), climate change is directly affecting the bushfires in Australia, and the fire seasons are becoming increasingly longer and more severe. Australia is already the driest continent on the planet, 
        and one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change in the developed world. During the month of November, Australia experienced their lowest level of rainfall, which was less than 1.9 inches throughout the entire region. The east coast of Australia has been experiencing a drought for three years now, and this has created the perfect conditions for a lengthy fire season. 
        Unfortunately, above average temperatures are expected through January which causes concern for continuation of the fires.
